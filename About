This App is a project with 2 main objectives: 
(1) To build my first Rails App; and 
(2) To build something useful for a dear friend who is dealing with a season of chronic orthopedic pain. 

My goal is to have a web-based app with a UI similar to Clue, that will empower the user to keep track of pain sympotoms,
triggers, pain management, and promote awareness and self-care.
